### **Handling Missing Values**:

- **Interest Rate, Inflation, GDP Growth, Unemployment Rate, Money 
Supply**: These datasets have **1938 missing values each** before 
preprocessing. During preprocessing, these missing values were likely 
filled using methods like forward filling or interpolation.
- **TED Spread**: This dataset has **67 missing values**, which might have 
been handled similarly during preprocessing.

---

### **Notes**:
- All datasets contain **numerical values** except for the `Date` column, 
which is a standard datetime format (YYYY-MM-DD).
- The missing values were handled during preprocessing, using 
forward filling techniques. Any remaining missing values 
were excluded from further analysis or imputed.
